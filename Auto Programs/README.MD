These simple applications are an auto mouse button clicker and an auto key presser!
When you run either application, you will be able to start or stop the key or click from automating by pressing the 'c' key. 
You can stop the applications from running and executing by pressing the 'b' key.
These start and stop keys can be changed in the code very easily!
You can also change the key that is being pressed or the button that is being clicked.
The same goes for the delay, or the time in between each action.

In order to run this code properly, you will need to install pynput to your python development environment.
This can be done using the following command in your cmd or python shell: pip install pynput

Once you have installed pynput, you should be able to run the application.
