These python files are some basic practice attempts with the unittest and pytest libraries.
I had previous experience with Javas JUnit for unit testing, so I thought I would check out how it is done in Python.
This was definitely a good experience because I was able to learn two different ways to run automated tests in Python.

The files for this little project are very simple.
There are two object files: SquareCalc and TriangleCalc.
These files have classes for square and triangle objects with math related callable methods.
The two test files run very basic tests to see if the math is done correctly.

OtherLib_test.py uses pytest
Square_Tests uses unittest
