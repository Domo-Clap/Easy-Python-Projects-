# Easy-Python-Projects-
This repository is a place for me to store practice applications I have made in Python.

I love working in python, especially when I am working with data. Python is the first programming language that I ever learned in college, and it has always stuck with me. I of course branched out into other languages like Java and C++, but Python was always there. It is super simple in terms of syntax and logic, and it is easy to create working prototypes of projects that you want to build further in the future. I primarily use Python to practice working with data. This includes using numpy and pandas in order to transform and prepare data. (I also use libraries like matplotlib to make small analytical graphs) However, this repository leans more away from the data side of uses with Python, and instead, focuses more on applications and UIs.

As a note, all of these projects are not to be taken as serious. They were built with the means of learning and growing as a developer. These projects are simple, but they have helped me learn a lot in terms of Python and its uses.
